<hr/>
A repository that contains my notes from Global AI Hub Machine Learning Bootcamp mashed with my own research. I explained things the way I understand and tried to keep it simple. You can make pull requests and add more notes if you'd like. i will keep adding more data as I expand my knowledge on the subject.

## What is Machine Learning?
 Machine learning is like teaching computers to learn from examples, just like how we learn from our day to day experiences. We show the computer lots of examples and tell it what's right or wrong. It uses these examples to get better at doing things on its own, like making predictions or recognizing patterns. It's like training a computer to be smart by showing it hundreds of pictures, numbers, or words.


## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a subcategory of machine learning. You show the program lots of examples, pictures, numbers, but in this case, we use data with labels. The program learns from these examples. When the program learns enough, we can give it new examples it hasn't seen before, and it will try to guess what the right label is.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a bit of an adventure. Imagine you are in library and books doesn't have labels on them. So you will need to sort them out. So you look at each and every book sort them by category, names, published dates, writers. You try to find similarities and try to find the best way the organise all the books so next time you will find whatever you are looking for faster.

This is exactly what you do in unsupervised learning. There are lots of data without any labels. Program looks at this data and tries to find patterns and similarities all by itself. It groups similar things together. The program keeps sorting and grouping until it thinks it found the best way to organize the data.

## Regression

## Decision trees
Decision tree is a tool that helps computers make choices. Instead of asking you questions, it uses facts and features to figure things out. The computer starts with a question, like "Is it red?" If the answer is yes, it might guess it's an apple. If the answer is no, it could guess it should be something else.
By asking a series of questions and getting answers, the computer can reach a decision, just like you would figure out what to do using a flowchart.

## Classification

Imagine you're a character in a zombie survival game where you encounter different kinds of zombies. Each zombie belongs to a specific class like "Normal", "Mutated","Special" And you're equipped with a special device that can analyze a zombie's appearance and behavior and determine its class so you will have more chance to survive if you encounter one with more information.

Classification in machine learning is like training this device we have to recognize and classify these zombies automatically. 
  1. You go out there and gather more data about these zombies like their sizes, how they look,how big they are, do they sprint or walk. 
  2. After that you label them as "Normal", "Special", "Mutated" and such. 
  3. Using the collected data and labels, you teach (train) a machine learning model how to associate features with zombies' classes.
  4. Once the model is trained, you can input the features of a new zombie it hasn't seen before. The model analyzes these features and predicts the class the zombie belongs to based on its learned patterns.
